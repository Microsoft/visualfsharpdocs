Welcome to the open F# documentation! As we transitioned the entire publishing pipeline for this document set to Open Publishing, we are now allowing public contributions to the docs. Built and validated documents are published [on MSDN](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualfsharpdocs/conceptual/visual-fsharp).

##Troubleshooting & Questions
