# Visual F# Documentation

Welcome to the open F# documentation! As we transitioned the entire publishing pipeline for this document set to Open Publishing, we are now allowing public contributions to the docs. Built and validated documents are published [on MSDN](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualfsharpdocs/conceptual/visual-fsharp).

##How to contribute
If you'd like to contribute to the F# documentation, all you need to do is:

1. [Clone the documentation repo](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/)
2. Make your tweaks (documents are formatted in Markdown - you can learn more about it on the [Daring Fireball page](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax)).
3. [Issue a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/) to the **live** branch.

Note: If some existing content seems to be missing or incomplete, browse the [previous MSDN documentation](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd233154%28v=vs.120%29.aspx) to port / adjust the content back.


Once we validate the change, we will merge the modifications.

##Troubleshooting & Questions
Simply [open an issue](https://github.com/Microsoft/visualfsharpdocs/issues) and we'll get in touch as soon as possible.
